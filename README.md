### Feature 1: Responsive Design

![Feature 1](images/responsive-design.png)
_This feature is essentially a preset of "warm" hex values. This is implemented by a few lines of code that randomises the hex value in a given array._

### Feature 2: Button highlights

_This feature randomizes the hex value. This code was difficult to implement, so I used stack overflow for help._
