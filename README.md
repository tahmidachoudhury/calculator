Below are some screenshots that provide a visual overview of the project:

### Main Interface

_The main screen. I can not take credit for the design as I saw an example project and really liked the clean, simple look. This is the only page of the site and here is where you can interact with all the different features._

### Feature 1: Responsive Design

![Feature 1](images/responsive-design.png)
_After learning more about CSS, I returned to this project and used media queries to make the calculator responsive to different display sizes_

### Feature 2: Button highlights

_Instead of keeping all buttons the same colour, I found other apps dynamically changing colour when interacted with. After implementing, it really improved the feel of the calculator and made it a lot easier on the eyes._
